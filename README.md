Titanic Classification
interpretability:Linear regression models are highly interpretable. The coefficients associated with each feature provide a clear understanding of the relationship between the input variables and the target variable. A positive coefficient means that an increase in that feature leads to an increase in the target variable, while a negative coefficient suggests the opposite.
Simplicity: Linear regression is straightforward and easy to implement. It serves as an excellent starting point for modeling and understanding relationships within data, especially when dealing with a small to moderate number of features.
Efficiency: Training a linear regression model is computationally efficient, and it can handle large datasets reasonably well. This efficiency makes it suitable for real-time and online learning applications
Linearity Assumption: While the linearity assumption is a limitation (as relationships in real-world data can be more complex), it can also be an advantage when dealing with data that exhibits linear trends. In such cases, linear regression can provide accurate predictions.
Baseline Model: Linear regression serves as a baseline model for many regression problems. It provides a benchmark against which more complex models can be compared. If a linear model performs well, there may be no need for more complicated models.
Feature Importance: Linear regression can help identify the most important features affecting the target variable. Coefficients with larger magnitudes indicate stronger feature importance.
